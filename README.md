# Foundation-Course-Samples
You can find the Free Sitefinity Foundation course here - https://pec.progress.com/course/1970519

This online video course includes 34 videos, each 8-18 minutes long. The videos apply to Sitefinity 13 and later.

You will learn how to use Sitefinity from a developer standpoint: how to extend it, build a robust content-driven site with code customizations, get to know its extensibility points, services and APIs. While there is a module about Sitefinity initial setup and configuration, it is expected that you download, install and license Sitefinity prior to taking the course. In this GitHub repo you can find a project which contains all the samples demonstrated in the training materials.

Going through the series you will learn how to:
* Set up a Sitefinity web application project from scratch
* Work with Sitefinity’s pages, widgets and content modules
* Develop your own content modules and widgets
* Customize Sitefinity’s built-in functionality and features
* Use Sitefinity’s APIs and services, and build your own
* Monitor your Sitefinity application
* And many more...
